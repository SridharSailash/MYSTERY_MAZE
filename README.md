MYSTERY_MAZE

This question was easy but very time consuming . i used the hardware set up and in arduino i used the bottons to move P to collect the letters of the word flag . it was frustrating due to the presence of portals and also the fact that the letters have to collected in the order F L A G .overall was easy .
